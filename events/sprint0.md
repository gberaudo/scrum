# Sprint 0

## The PO should:
- get an estimate from the team about how much time is needed for the whole project (release planning);
- do the grooming of the first 2 sprints (functional stories that will come after), get story points (and time estimates?) from the team;
- infrastructure, ensure everything is clear with the sysadmins regarding dev/int/prod environments;
- ask the team to define how to develop, test, release, ensure there is an appropriate techincal basis at the end of the sprint;
- adapt the team to be efficient for this particular sprint.


## The dev team should:
- ensure the whole chain from source to production is in place;
- all testing environment is set up;
- the next sprint will require no more setup.
