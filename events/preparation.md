# Project preparation

## The management should

- choose a PO and a SM
For a given project the management should choose a unique (PO, SM) pair.
These 2 persons must be interested by the project and willing to work together.


## The PO should
- choose a project team that is consistent with the technical scope (all knowledge in the team);
- together with the SM, decide sprint length, definitions of done and ready;
- prepare the JIRA project and add the high level stories / epics to the backlog;
- order the backlog cards by priority: top of the backlog is the most urgent;
- create chat room, create dev mailinglist;
- in the calendar, book the kickoff.
