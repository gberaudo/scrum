# Retrospective

- Managed by the SM;
- not timeboxed;
- Scrum master, team, (PO if team is OK);
- Compute and show the sprint statistics, try collectively to explain the numbers;
- Get feedback from the team;
- Review improving actions and establish new ones;
- Eventually choose who will present the next sprint demo, organize dailies and other sprint duties.
