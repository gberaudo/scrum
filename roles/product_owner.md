# Product Owner (PO) role

## During the project
- manage the backlog cards based on client needs (write the specs, priorize the cards, eventually fill in business values).
- get time for the team at the weekly plannings (consistent with the active sprint commitment);
- validate the developements as soon as possible, before the end of each sprint and pass the cards to "customer review".
- in the calendar, book the backlog grooming / demo / retrospective / sprint planning events;
